# GitHub User Activity

Project to enhance skills in building a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal.

## Requirements
To succesfully run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
